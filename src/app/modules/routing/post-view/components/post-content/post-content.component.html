      Speculation that William Shakespeare traveled, worked as a schoolmaster in the country, was a soldier and a law clerk, or embraced or left the
      Roman Catholic Church continues to fill the gaps left in the sparse records of the so-called lost years. It is conventionally assumed (though
      attendance registers do not survive) that Shakespeare attended the King’s New School in Stratford, along with others of his social class. At the
      age of 18, in November 1582, he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a local farmer. She was pregnant with Susanna Shakespeare, who was baptized
      on May 26, 1583. The twins, Hamnet and Judith Shakespeare, were baptized on February 2, 1585. There were no further children from the union.
      William Shakespeare had probably been working as an actor and writer on the professional stage in London for four or five years when the London
      theaters were closed by order of the Privy Council on June 23, 1592. The authorities were concerned about a severe outbreak of the plague and
      alarmed at the possibility of civil unrest (Privy Council minutes refer to “a great disorder and tumult” in Southwark). The initial order
      suspended playing until Michaelmas and was renewed several times. When the theaters reopened in June 1594, the theatrical companies had been
      reorganized, and Shakespeare’s career was wholly committed to the troupe known as the Lord Chamberlain’s Men until 1603, when they were
      reconstituted as the King’s Men. By 1592 Shakespeare already enjoyed sufficient prominence as an author of dramatic scripts to have been the
      subject of Robert Greene’s attack on the “upstart crow” in Greene’s Groatsworth of Wit. Such renown as he enjoyed, however, was as transitory as
      the dramatic form. Play scripts, and their authors, were accorded a lowly status in the literary system, and when scripts were published, their
      link to the theatrical company (rather than to the scriptwriter) was publicized. It was only in 1597 that Shakespeare’s name first appeared on
      the title page of his plays—Richard II and
